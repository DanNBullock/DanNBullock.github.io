This project is hoped to help adress an apparent gap in the open-source and scientific-software landscape.  Namely, the lack of an automated method for generating software citations within and/or for scientific software packages.  The consequences of this shortcoming have been discussed at length elsewhere (see [Citations](https://github.com/DanNBullock/citeas-on-requirements#publications) for some of these publications).  With the provison of this capability (or at least this proof of concept), it is hoped that the hurdles to the production of software bibliographies--which would otherwise have to be produced manually--are reduced.

# OCT & MAIA Scripts
OCT & MAIA Scripts



These code resources are designed for the processing, analyzing and visualizing data from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) (in particular data generated using OrionÂ® software (Voxeleron, LLC, Pleasanton, CA, USA)) and Macular Integrity Assessment (MAIA), at both the individual and group levels.  This resource was developed in collaboration with [Jasleen Jolly](https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/research-directory/jasleen-jolly).

The code and script repository includes documentation of input and intermediary data objects [[OCT](https://github.com/DanNBullock/OCT_scripts/blob/master/OCTcode/convertToSubject.md), [brainlife datatype optometry/oct](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5ebe0bbbb969982124072325/readme)], and is primarily written in matlab, though some MAIA visualization functionality is also available in python.

Additionally, these code tools are also available in the form of applications on [brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io/)
([MAIA](https://brainlife.io/app/605b9143edebf0f4fdd2a7cc) and [OCT](https://brainlife.io/app/5ec4646f41ba118064f44d41))

The degree of interaction between the ventral and dorsal visual streams has been discussed in multiple scientific domains for decades. Recently, several white matter tracts that directly connect cortical regions associated with the dorsal and ventral streams have become possible to study due to advancements in automated and reproducible methods. The developmental trajectory of this set of tracts, here referred to as the posterior vertical pathway (PVP), has yet to be described. We propose an input-driven model of white matter development and provide evidence for the model by focusing on the development of the PVP. We used reproducible, cloud-computing methods and diffusion imaging from adults and children (ages 5â€“8 years) to compare PVP development to that of tracts within the ventral and dorsal pathways. PVP microstructure was more adult-like than dorsal stream microstructure, but less adult-like than ventral stream microstructure. Additionally, PVP microstructure was more similar to the microstructure of the ventral than the dorsal stream and was predicted by performance on a perceptual task in children. Overall, results suggest a potential role for the PVP in the development of the dorsal visual stream that may be related to its ability to facilitate interactions between ventral and dorsal streams during learning. Our results are consistent with the proposed model, suggesting that the microstructural development of major white matter pathways is related, at least in part, to the propagation of sensory information within the visual system.

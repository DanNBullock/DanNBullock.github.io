Historically, the primary focus of studies of human white matter tracts has been on large tracts that connect anterior-to-posterior cortical regions. These include the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). Recently, more refined and well-understood tractography methods have facilitated the characterization of several tracts in the posterior of the human brain that connect dorsal-to-ventral cortical regions. These include the vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF), the posterior arcuate fasciculus (pArc), the temporo-parietal connection (TP-SPL), and the middle longitudinal fasciculus (MdLF). The addition of these dorso-ventral connective tracts to our standard picture of white matter architecture results in a more complicated pattern of white matter connectivity than previously considered. Dorso-ventral connective tracts may play a role in transferring information from superior horizontal tracts, such as the SLF, to inferior horizontal tracts, such as the IFOF and ILF. We present a full anatomical delineation of these major dorso-ventral connective white matter tracts (the VOF, pArc, TP-SPL, and MdLF). We show their spatial layout and cortical termination mappings in relation to the more established horizontal tracts (SLF, IFOF, ILF, and Arc) and consider standard values for quantitative features associated with the aforementioned tracts. We hope to facilitate further study on these tracts and their relations. To this end, we also share links to automated code that segments these tracts, thereby providing a standard approach to obtaining these tracts for subsequent analysis. We developed open source software to allow reproducible segmentation of the tracts: https://github.com/brainlife/Vertical_Tracts. Finally, we make the segmentation method available as an open cloud service on the data and analyses sharing platform brainlife.io. Investigators will be able to access these services and upload their data to segment these tracts.

excerpt: 'Despite their respective receptor specificities, both clozapine (CLZ) and deschloroclozapine (DCZ) have partial affinity for a variety of endogenous receptors and can induce dose-specific changes even in naïve animals. This complicates their use as actuator ligands for Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs).  In this study we aimed to examine the effects of these compounts on resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and intrinsic neural timescales (INTs) in drug-naïve, non-human primates. <br/><br/><img src="/images/cushnie2022_WordCloud.svg">'

Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) are engineered receptors that allow for genetically targeted, reversible manipulation of cellular activity via systemic drug administration. DREADD induced manipulations are initiated via the binding of an actuator ligand. Therefore, the use of DREADDs is contingent on the availability of actuator ligands. Actuator ligands low-dose clozapine (CLZ) and deschloroclozapine (DCZ) are highly selective for DREADDs, and upon binding, induce physiological and behavioral changes in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHPs). Despite this reported specificity, both CLZ and DCZ have partial affinity for a variety of endogenous receptors and can induce dose-specific changes even in naïve animals. As such, this study aimed to examine the effects of CLZ and DCZ on resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and intrinsic neural timescales (INTs) in naïve NHPs. In doing so, we are evaluating whether CLZ and DCZ – in the absence of DREADDs – are inert by examining the ligands’ effects on the innate functional properties of the brain. Low-dose DCZ did not induce consistent changes in rs-FC or INTs prior to the expression of DREADDs; however, a high dose resulted in subject-specific changes in rs-FC and INTs. In contrast, CLZ administration induced consistent changes in rs-FC and INTs prior to DREADD expression in our subjects. Our results caution against the use of CLZ by explicitly demonstrating the impact of off-target effects that can confound experimental results. Altogether, these data endorse the use of low dose DCZ for future DREADD-based experiments.

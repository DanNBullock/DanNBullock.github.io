The anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) is a white matter structure that connects the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the brainstem, thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus. It is a target for deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is strong interest in improving deep brain stimulation targeting by using diffusion tractography to reconstruct and target specific ALIC fiber pathways, but this methodology is susceptible to errors and lacks validation. To address these limitations, we developed a novel diffusion tractography pipeline that generates reliable and biologically validated ALIC white matter reconstructions.

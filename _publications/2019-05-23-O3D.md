We describe the Open Diffusion Data Derivatives (O3D) repository: an integrated collection of preserved brain data derivatives and processing pipelines, published together using a single digital-object-identifier. The data derivatives were generated using modern diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data (dMRI) with diverse properties of resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to the data, we publish all processing pipelines (also referred to as open cloud services). The pipelines utilize modern methods for neuroimaging data processing (diffusion-signal modelling, fiber tracking, tractography evaluation, white matter segmentation, and structural connectome construction). The O3D open services can allow cognitive and clinical neuroscientists to run the connectome mapping algorithms on new, user-uploaded, data. Open source code implementing all O3D services is also provided to allow â€¦

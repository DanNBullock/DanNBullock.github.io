Segmenting white matter bundles from human tractograms is a task of interest for several applications. Current methods for bundle segmentation consider either only prior knowledge about the relative anatomical position of a bundle, or only its geometrical properties. Our aim is to improve the results of segmentation by proposing a method that takes into account information about both the underlying anatomy and the geometry of bundles at the same time. To achieve this goal, we extend a state-of-the-art example-based method based on the Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) by including prior anatomical information within the optimization process. The proposed method shows a significant improvement with respect to the original method, in particular on small bundles.

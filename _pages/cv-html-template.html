<!-- The following is a css file for taking in curriculum vitae information stored in a json file and displaying it in a web page. -->
<!-- it also includes a toggle button for switching between an "academic" version, and a "non-academic version, which switches between the "technical" and "non-technical" skills associated with various entries. -->
<!-- The json file itself is stored in the "files" folder and is called "curriculumVitae.json". -->

title: the paper's title
collection: the collection it belongs to (currently all are "publications")
permalink: the link to the paper blurb within this website
excerpt: an exerpt which serves as a short description of the paper
date: the date of publication
venue: the venue of publication
